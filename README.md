# Portfolio: Deep Learning Projects

## Welcome!

Welcome to my portfolio! All of my projects are focused on deep learning research and applications. Through these projects, I aim to explore various models and techniques in neural networks, generative models, segmentation, and classification tasks. Below is a list of the key projects I have worked on, with links to the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.

## Projects

### 1. Autoencoders (AE, VAE, CVAE) for Image Generation and Embedding Extraction
- **Datasets:** LFM, MNIST
- **Description:** Implemented and trained several types of autoencoders: basic Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). These models were used to generate images and extract meaningful embeddings.
- **Notebook:** [autoencoders.ipynb](./dl-projects/autoencoders.ipynb)

### 2. Image Segmentation using SegNet and UNet Architectures
- **Dataset:** PH2 (Skin Lesion Segmentation)
- **Description:** Solved the segmentation task using SegNet and UNet architectures. Experimented with different loss functions including Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), Dice, and Focal loss to improve segmentation accuracy.
- **Notebook:** [segmentation.ipynb](./dl-projects/segmentation.ipynb)

### 3. Multi-Class Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Dataset:** [Journey-Springfield](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/journey-springfield/overview) (from Kaggle)
- **Description:** Addressed a multi-class classification problem using CNNs. Employed various augmentation techniques to enhance model performance. Achieved a Kaggle score of **0.989**.
- **Notebook:** [simpsons.ipynb](./dl-projects/simpsons.ipynb)

### 4. Fully Connected Perceptron for Classification
- **Datasets:** MNIST, Moons
- **Description:** Implemented and trained a fully connected perceptron network to solve classification tasks on the MNIST dataset and a synthetic "Moons" dataset.
- **Notebook:** [NN.ipynb](./dl-projects/NN.ipynb)
